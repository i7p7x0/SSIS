Hello Holli, 

It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I was delighted to read your email and appreciate your kind words. Please feel free to include as you wish in the next Udemy newsletter. For me, it would be an honor. 

I have attached a picture of me learning along with this email. And to speak about myself and my “why” for learning, 

I have been here at Cotiviti for eleven months working as a developer for Submissions team in Nepal. Learning to me, is a positive constant that helps improve and expand my skill set, keep up with the rapidly changing world and make my job feel more fulfilling to me. I learn because learning makes me a better version of myself. It has now grown on me to become a hobby and a daily habit. 

Like every other hobby, learning too demands time, energy, and discipline. I give and can give as much time to learning in Udemy as I do because I am part of a wonderful team filled with competitive colleagues led by an encouraging manager who bring out the best in me for which I feel truly blessed. 

Thanks again and please let me know if you require any further input. 

Regards, 

Ishan.
